(autoload 'magit-add-section-hook "magit-section" "\
Add to the value of section hook HOOK the function FUNCTION.

Add FUNCTION at the beginning of the hook list unless optional
APPEND is non-nil, in which case FUNCTION is added at the end.
If FUNCTION already is a member, then move it to the new location.

If optional AT is non-nil and a member of the hook list, then
add FUNCTION next to that instead.  Add before or after AT, or
replace AT with FUNCTION depending on APPEND.  If APPEND is the
symbol `replace', then replace AT with FUNCTION.  For any other
non-nil value place FUNCTION right after AT.  If nil, then place
FUNCTION right before AT.  If FUNCTION already is a member of the
list but AT is not, then leave FUNCTION where ever it already is.

If optional LOCAL is non-nil, then modify the hook's buffer-local
value rather than its global value.  This makes the hook local by
copying the default value.  That copy is then modified.

HOOK should be a symbol.  If HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.
HOOK's value must not be a single hook function.  FUNCTION should
be a function that takes no arguments and inserts one or multiple
sections at point, moving point forward.  FUNCTION may choose not
to insert its section(s), when doing so would not make sense.  It
should not be abused for other side-effects.  To remove FUNCTION
again use `remove-hook'.
